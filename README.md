# AI To Save Endangered Languages

Final Building AI course project

## Summary

The project aims to explore AI methods and create tools to preserve and revival languages of endangered nations and ethnic minorities. This is an attempt to save the worldâ€™s cultural diversity.

## Background

Language is an essential part of any culture. With the help of language, people preserve their history, customs, and traditions, transmit knowledge and unique ways of thinking. There are about 7,000 languages globally, but about 43% of them are endangered or about to be extinct. Many of these languages are disappearing at an alarming rate as communities that speak them face assimilation, poverty, educational disadvantage, and migration. Younger generations prefer languages that they consider more modern to get an education and build a good career.

Many of these languages are spoken by indigenous peoples, and they are disappearing at an alarming rate. There are also many dead languages that no one speaks anymore. Given the complex systems of knowledge and culture that these local languages have developed and accumulated over thousands of years, their disappearance means losing a kind of cultural treasure.

The tragic consequence of languages extinction:
* lost of cultural heritage
* lost of unique modes of thinking, meaning and expression
* lost of cultural diversity

Some of the problems that ethnic minorities face:
* limited access to information
* lack of education in the native language
* lack of highly qualified job
* limited opportunities to express freely thought, opinion, and expression


## How is it used?

Some examples of the sucessful projects you can find in the article "EMBRACING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO PRESERVE DYING LANGUAGES".

I will be happy for any contribution or help. Also, I'm open to an invitation to participate in a project with the same field of interest.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Leave some notes where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

At this stage, the project does not have a specific goal. It could be ML technology that provides effective storage and processing of data and identifying patterns to understand the structure of the language. It could be a platform that allows us to learn endangered languages and practice them with other people. The aim is to save cultural heritage.

## What next?

For this project, we need:

* people who are interested in the subject
* linguists
* historians 
* software engineers
* data engineers
* AI consultants
